**New Features**

-  Workspaces: Adds Projects, which are collections of experiments, and Workspaces, which are
   collections of projects. Users can use the WebUI or CLI to create, edit, and delete workspaces
   and projects, as well as moving experiments to different projects and projects to different
   workspaces. To create an experiment in a project, add ``workspace`` and ``project`` fields in the
   experiment configuration. Any experiments where those fields are not specified will be added to
   the Uncategorized project. Run ``det workspace --help`` and ``det project â€“help`` for more
   information.

**Breaking Changes**

-  Web: Removes the Dashboard and Experiment List pages. All existing experiments were moved into the
      default Uncategorized project, which is linked in the navigation bar.
